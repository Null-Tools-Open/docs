Make NullBoard your own with flexible interface and theme options.

### Themes
Switch between **Light**, **Dark**, or **System** themes via the Top-Left Menu to match your environment. You can also set a specific **Canvas Background** color independent of the UI theme.

### Interface Layout
Customize the workspace to fit your handedness or preference:
1. Open the **Menu**.
2. Select **"Edit Interface Layout"**.
3. Drag UI elements (Toolbar, Menu, etc.) to any side of the screen (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).
4. Save your layout to make it permanent.
