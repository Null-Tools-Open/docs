## Power Features

### Command Palette
Speed up your workflow with the Command Palette. Press `Ctrl + /` (or `Cmd + /` on Mac) to instantly search for and execute any action in the application, from changing tools to exporting files.

### Workspaces
Manage your projects effectively:
- **Save as...**: Download your current board state as a `.json` file for backup or sharing.
- **Open**: Load a previously saved `.json` board.
- **Workspaces Manager**: Switch between different active boards (saved locally or in the cloud for signed-in users).

### Debugging
For developers and contributors, NullBoard includes a debug overlay.
- Toggle it via **Settings** (`Ctrl + ,`) > **Whiteboard** > **Debug View**.
- *Note: This displays performance metrics and state information primarily useful for development.*
