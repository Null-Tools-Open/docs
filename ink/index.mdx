**@impulsedev/ink** is a specialized library designed to recognize handwritten digits and mathematical operators directly in the browser. It features a unique **client-side auto-training** capability, allowing it to adapt and learn without heavy server-side models.

## Key Features

- **Math Recognition**: accurate detection of digits (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /, =).
- **Auto-Training**: The library can train its own lightweight CNN model in the browser using bundled sample data. Zero server configuration required.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Automatically parses recognized characters into valid mathematical expressions and calculates the result.
- **Stroke Management**: Built-in tools for capturing, storing, and manipulating handwriting strokes.
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed for a robust development experience.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @impulsedev/ink
```

## Quick Start

Here is a minimal example to initialize the library and recognize a simple drawing.

```typescript
import { Ink } from '@impulsedev/ink';

// Initialize Ink
// By default, this starts the auto-training process in the background
const ink = new Ink();

// Wait for the model to be ready (trains or loads)
await ink.loadModel();

// ... (Integration with your canvas to capture strokes) ...

// Recognize the current drawing
const result = await ink.recognize();

if (result.valid) {
  console.log(`Expression: ${result.expression}`); // Output: "2 + 2"
  console.log(`Result: ${result.result}`);         // Output: 4
}
```
