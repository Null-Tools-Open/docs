## Overview

**NullBoard** is designed to be a flexible, infinite workspace where you can organize thoughts, plan projects, and collaborate with your team without boundaries. Whether you're brainstorming, diagramming, or just taking notes, NullBoard adapts to your workflow.

## Core Features

### Infinite Canvas
Break free from page limits. NullBoard provides an unbounded workspace that grows with your ideas.
- **Pan**: Hold `Space` or select the **Hand Tool** (`H`) to drag the canvas view.
- **Zoom**: Use `Ctrl + Scroll` or the on-screen zoom controls to focus on details or see the big picture.

### Real-time Collaboration (Beta)
Work together with your team, no matter where they are.
1. Open the Menu and select **Real-time collaboration**.
2. **Start Session**: Become the host and share your unique Room ID.
3. **Join Session**: Enter a Room ID to jump into a colleague's board.
<Tip>Use the **Laser Pointer** tool (`K`) during sessions to highlight areas for other participants without making permanent marks.</Tip>

## Customization

Make NullBoard your own with flexible interface and theme options.

### Themes
Switch between **Light**, **Dark**, or **System** themes via the Top-Left Menu to match your environment. You can also set a specific **Canvas Background** color independent of the UI theme.

### Interface Layout
Customize the workspace to fit your handedness or preference:
1. Open the **Menu**.
2. Select **"Edit Interface Layout"**.
3. Drag UI elements (Toolbar, Menu, etc.) to any side of the screen (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).
4. Save your layout to make it permanent.

## Power Features

### Command Palette
Speed up your workflow with the Command Palette. Press `Ctrl + /` (or `Cmd + /` on Mac) to instantly search for and execute any action in the application, from changing tools to exporting files.

### Workspaces
Manage your projects effectively:
- **Save as...**: Download your current board state as a `.json` file for backup or sharing.
- **Open**: Load a previously saved `.json` board.
- **Workspaces Manager**: Switch between different active boards (saved locally or in the cloud for signed-in users).

### Debugging
For developers and contributors, NullBoard includes a debug overlay.
- Toggle it via **Settings** (`Ctrl + ,`) > **Whiteboard** > **Debug View**.
- *Note: This displays performance metrics and state information primarily useful for development.*
